## Integrating Azure Key Vault with Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines allows you to securely manage and access secrets, keys, and certificates during your build and release processes. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:

**Step 1: Create an Azure Key Vault**
* First, create an Azure Key Vault to store your secrets.
```
    az keyvault create --name <your-keyvault-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --location <your-location>
```
**Step 2: Add Secrets to Key Vault**
* Add the secrets you need for your CI/CD pipeline.
```
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name <your-keyvault-name> --name <your-secret-name> --value <your-secret-value>
```
**Step 3: Set Up Access Policies**
* Grant Azure DevOps access to your Key Vault by setting up access policies.
```
    az keyvault set-policy --name <your-keyvault-name> --spn <your-service-principal-id> --secret-permissions get
```
**Step 4: Create a Service Connection in Azure DevOps**

* Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
* Go to Project Settings > Service connections.
* Click on New service connection and select Azure Resource Manager.
* Choose Service principal (automatic) and fill in the required details.
* Verify the connection and save it.

**Step 5: Use Secrets in Your Pipeline**

* Modify your pipeline YAML file to use the secrets from Azure Key Vault.
  
Example YAML Pipeline
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  - group: KeyVaultSecrets

steps:
- task: UseKeyVault@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your-service-connection>'
    KeyVaultName: '<your-keyvault-name>'
    SecretsFilter: '*'
    RunAsPreJob: true

- script: echo $(<your-secret-name>)
  displayName: 'Display secret'
```
**Step 6: Run Your Pipeline**
* Run your pipeline to ensure that it can access the secrets from Azure Key Vault.
